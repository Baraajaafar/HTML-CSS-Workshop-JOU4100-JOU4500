            <p>I took this pickture when I was in Spain, this place was 15 minutes walk from where I worked and there was a small waterfall</p>
            <p>next to it. dring a very hot summer day, all the famlies who live in the area would go there and take their kids for a swim</p>
            <p>those famlies live in a country where they could go to the most beautiful city that's only a few hours away from where they live</p>
            <p>but they chose to spent their weekend in this simple place.</p>
            <p>This small villag had only 35 famly who lived in it. They all knew each other, all spend their days doing almost the same things</p>
            <p>and spent their fridy night in the same bar every week with the same people.</p>
            <p>it was a very peacefull idea and way of living that made me feel like i was living in a different era.</p>

              <p>I was looking for Sunrise places in Ottawa, and it turned out that there're almost non</p>
              <p>however, I tried to go to some places that has a nice sunset hoping it has a better view for a sunrise </p>
              <p>but that's all of what I've got to see. It was nice but I was hoping for a view that's uncovered by buildings.</p>
