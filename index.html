            <h2>some information about me first</h2>
            <p>I love hiking and being outdoors. I started descovering some new places when I came to Gatineau</p>
            <p>because I was suranded by trees and nature. I believe that I went to lmost every hiking trail in Gatineau</p>
            <p>Then I started going a bit further, not so much, just 8 hours away. my furthest so far in a car</p>

              <h3>Some things I am interested in</h3>
              <p>if you ask someone about their hobby, they would tell you about something they have been doing since they were kids</p>
              <p>Well that's not the case with me. I started liking a few things in my early 20s and here's a list of the things i like to do</p>

                <li>I also like designing</li>
                <li>I like writing</li>
                <li>and last, I really like going to coffee shops</li> 
              </ol>

              <p>here's my favourit quote</p>
              
              <blockquote lang="ar"cite="https://quran.com">
                
        
                 ּو ؏ــڛۣــۍۧ ּا̍نۨ ̨ٺــګــڔہ ۖ ڜــېْۧــٸ و ۖ هــﯜٰ̍ا̍ څۡــۑْۧــڔٰ̍ا̍ ڶــڬــمۭ
            
              </blockquote>
              <p>it means, sometimes when you hate something happened to you, it might means that God knew it wasn't good for you.</p>
