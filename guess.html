            <h1>here's my favourit trip ever</h1>
            <p>it was my longest road trip, which was 8 hours driving</p>
            <p>the road looked like that:</p>

            <h2>Some background info about this trip</h2>
            <p>I was looking for a place to go with my best friend for her birthday and I found this place which I thought it would be a great gift</p>
            <p>but it was too far for us to go so after a few days my boyfriend wanted to go somewhere and take a vacation from work</p>
            <p> so I showed him this place and he loves road trips as much as I do so we went there</p>
            <h3>Here's another view of the road</h3>
